UniGen is an almost-uniform generator of SAT witnesses for a given CNF formula. The code is based on hashing-based framework developed over the years. See overview paper [here](http://www.cs.rice.edu/~kgm2/Papers/BNP16.pdf) 

For more details on hashing-based approach, please visit: http://www.kuldeepmeel.com

Installation and usage instructions can be found in the "README.md" file in the "ugen2" folder.
Benchmarks can be found [here](https://github.com/meelgroup/unigen-benchmarks). Please see the appendix of our TACAS 2015 [paper](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~meel/Papers/Tacas15.pdf) for statistics on them.
